# VIS145-Final
Final project for vis145a.
This is a web-based customer support for neural implant users in the future. I was also particularly inspired by the concept of cyberbrain from one of my favorite anime, Ghost in the shell, which introduces a possible future where people would integrate electronics in their biological brains and thus able to connect with diverse networks. 

I use gTTS API in python to convert text into speech and insert audios into the webpage to simulate the sound of the AI assistants. The photo profile image of the AI assistant is from computer-generated faces. (see https://thispersondoesnotexist.com) There are also buttons in the main page that direct the user to different pages and allow the user to listen to the instructions from the AI assistant. The framework of code is developed from the https://github.com/DesignAtLarge/ixd-skeleton.
