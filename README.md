# VIS145-Final
Final project for vis145a.
As far as I am concerned, media serves as a communication tool which connects users to service providers, and other users who share the similar experience. Since industrialization, machines started to replace human labors. Currently we still have human customer service but there is a trend of using algorithms and artificial intelligence to handle specialized or repetitive problems. However, there are drawbacks of using algorithms, as they may contain bias and lack of flexibility to deal with various circumstances. According to Megan Garcia in the paper called Racist in the machine: the Disturbing Implications of Algorithmic Bias, algorithms have bias since artificial intelligence may take unnoticed data that could not be corrected by human. 
More importantly, the author points out that computers exacerbate the existing prejudices in the system due to the self-reinforcing nature of machine learning, especially in a technology age as of now. In the future, I assume there will be even fewer human workers and accessing human communications in working industries will be harder or at a higher cost. Additionally, one of our class screenings, Numbers Station: Manifests (2016) by Mendi & Keith Obadike, which represents people in mere numbers, I feel this is quite relatable especially when we head into the big data era, where people’s individualistic experience and stories were silenced.
I was also particularly inspired by the concept of cyberbrain from one of my favorite anime, Ghost in the shell, which introduces a possible future where people would integrate electronics in their biological brains and thus able to connect with diverse networks. Therefore, I made this art project, a web-based customer support for neural implant users in the future. I use gTTS API in python to convert text into speech and insert audios into the webpage to simulate the sound of the AI assistants. The photo profile image of the AI assistant is from computer-generated faces. (see https://thispersondoesnotexist.com) There are also buttons in the main page that direct the user to different pages and allow the user to listen to the instructions from the AI assistant. The framework of code is developed from the https://github.com/DesignAtLarge/ixd-skeleton.
